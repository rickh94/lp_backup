# Installation

You must install the [lastpass cli](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) and have it available in your path.


You will need Python 3.6 or later installed, as well as pip.

For now, [clone the repo](https://github.com/rickh94/lp_backup) and run
```
$ python3 setup.py install
```

 from inside it.
You may want to do it in a virtual environment.
